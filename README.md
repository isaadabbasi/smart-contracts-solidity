### Why this hustle:
*In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.* -- Albert Einstein

There's no better way to learn it than doing it. Having over 7 years of professional coding experience, and Full stack javascript engineer, Its always nice to add one more block to the chain of skills. 
My approach to professionalism is more generalist than specialist. I, already have good grip and reasonable experience in Frontend, Backend, Database, Infrastructure and understanding of Blockchain systems (7+ years in total). Adding these complex and top level contracts makes my stack more versatile and complete for at least next 5 years.
